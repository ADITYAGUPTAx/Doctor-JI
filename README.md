# ABSTRACT
The global healthcare system grapples with challenges of accessibility, affordability, and diagnostic accuracy, particularly in underserved regions. Doctor Ji is an AI-powered mobile application designed to address these issues by integrating a rule-based chatbot, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for skin condition diagnostics, and multi-service features such as ambulance booking, doctor appointments, emergency SOS, and medical record management. Built using Flutter for crossplatform compatibility and Firebase for scalable backend services, the app leverages the HAM10000 dataset and ResNet18 architecture to achieve ∼85% diagnostic accuracy. This paper provides an in-depth exploration of the system’s architecture, methodology, implementation, performance evaluation, and realworld applications through case studies. It also explains foundational AI concepts like CNNs, ResNets, and activation functions to ensure accessibility for non-technical readers while maintaining a professional tone. The paper concludes with challenges, limitations, and future enhancements to expand Doctor Ji’s impact in democratizing healthcare.
 # KEY FEATURES

To address these gaps, Doctor Ji is developed as an all-inone mobile health (mHealth) application powered by artificial intelligence (AI). The app integrates:
• A rule-based chatbot for health guidance and symptom analysis.
• A convolutional neural network (CNN) for diagnosing skin conditions with ∼85% accuracy.
• Multi-service features, including ambulance booking,doctor appointment scheduling, emergency SOS, and medical record management.
Built using Flutter for seamless cross-platform performance and Firebase for robust backend services, Doctor Ji aims to provide accessible, affordable, and reliable healthcare solutions. This paper elaborates on the system’s architecture,methodology, implementation details, performance metrics, and practical applications through imaginary case studies. It also provides detailed explanations of AI concepts such as CNNs, ResNets, and activation functions to ensure clarity for diverse readers, while maintaining a professional and technical depth suitable for academic and industry audiences.
