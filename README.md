# Skin Disease Detection with ResNet-50 on HAM10000

This project trains a deep learning model using **ResNet-50** to classify skin diseases from the **HAM10000 dataset** (Human Against Machine with 10,000 training images). The dataset contains dermatoscopic images of skin lesions categorized into **7 classes**:

* **akiec**: Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma
* **bcc**: Basal cell carcinoma
* **bkl**: Benign keratosis-like lesions
* **df**: Dermatofibroma
* **mel**: Melanoma
* **nv**: Melanocytic nevi
* **vasc**: Vascular lesions

---

## üîπ Project Workflow

### 1. Dataset Preparation

* The HAM10000 dataset is downloaded using **KaggleHub**.
* Two ZIP archives (`HAM10000_images_part_1.zip`, `HAM10000_images_part_2.zip`) are extracted.
* Metadata file (`HAM10000_metadata.csv`) is used to map `image_id` to diagnosis (`dx`) labels.
* Final dataframe contains image paths + encoded labels.

### 2. Data Preprocessing

* Images resized to **224√ó224√ó3** (ResNet-50 input size).
* Pixel values normalized using **ResNet-50 preprocess\_input** (scales to \[-1, 1]).
* Data augmentation with TensorFlow preprocessing layers:

  * Random horizontal flips
  * Random rotations (¬±10%)
  * Random zooms
  * Random contrast changes
* Train/validation/test split: **70% / 15% / 15%** with stratification.

### 3. Handling Class Imbalance

* The dataset is highly imbalanced (e.g., many `nv` samples, few `df`).
* **Class weights** are computed with `sklearn.utils.class_weight` to penalize underrepresented classes.

### 4. Model Architecture

* Base: **ResNet-50 pretrained on ImageNet**, without the fully connected (top) layer.
* Added layers:

  * Global Average Pooling
  * Dropout (0.3)
  * Dense softmax output (7 classes)
* Training strategy:

  1. **Stage 1**: Freeze most of ResNet-50, train only the top layers.
  2. **Stage 2 (Fine-tuning)**: Unfreeze the top 50 ResNet layers and train with a lower learning rate.

### 5. Training Setup

* **Loss**: Categorical Crossentropy
* **Optimizer**: Adam (`lr=1e-4` ‚Üí reduced to `2e-5` for fine-tuning)
* **Metrics**: Accuracy
* **Callbacks**:

  * EarlyStopping (patience=6, monitor=val\_accuracy)
  * ReduceLROnPlateau (halve LR if val\_loss plateaus)
  * ModelCheckpoint (save best model by val\_accuracy)
  * CSVLogger (log training progress)

### 6. Evaluation

* Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report (precision, recall, F1-score).
* Expected performance:

  * Train Accuracy: \~85‚Äì90%
  * Validation Accuracy: \~78‚Äì82%
  * Test Accuracy: \~78‚Äì82%
* Accuracy is limited by class imbalance, so F1-score is the preferred metric.

## üîπ Files & Artifacts

* `best_model.keras` ‚Üí Saved trained ResNet-50 model.
* `label_map.json` ‚Üí Mapping of class labels to indices.
* `history.csv` ‚Üí Training history (loss/accuracy per epoch).

---

## üîπ Inference Example

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import json
from pathlib import Path

# Load model & label map
model = load_model("artifacts/best_model.keras")
with open("artifacts/label_map.json") as f:
    label_map = json.load(f)
labels = list(label_map.keys())

# Prediction helper
def predict_image(image_path):
    img = tf.io.read_file(image_path)
    img = tf.image.decode_jpeg(img, channels=3)
    img = tf.image.resize(img, (224,224))
    img = tf.cast(img, tf.float32)
    img = tf.keras.applications.resnet50.preprocess_input(img)
    img = tf.expand_dims(img, axis=0)
    preds = model.predict(img)[0]
    idx = np.argmax(preds)
    return labels[idx], float(preds[idx])

print(predict_image("HAM10000_images_part_1/ISIC_0024306.jpg"))
```

Output:

```
('nv', 0.92)
```

## üîπ Technical Highlights

* **ResNet-50 Backbone**: Deep residual connections help avoid vanishing gradients and enable training of very deep networks.
* **Transfer Learning**: Pretrained ImageNet weights accelerate convergence and improve generalization.
* **Class Imbalance Handling**: Using `class_weight` ensures minority classes (like `df`) get properly recognized.
* **Fine-tuning**: Gradually unfreezing deeper layers allows the model to learn skin-specific features while retaining generic image features.
